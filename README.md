# CESSDA F-UJI bulk assessment: Command Line Runner

This repository contains the source code needed to run a bulk FAIR assessment of the
contents of the CESSDA Data Catalogue. It does this by iterating through the list of
URLs in the CDC sitemap and calling the F-UJI API for each one.

More details can be found in
[Bulk FAIR assessment of the CESSDA Data Catalogue using the F-UJI API](https://zenodo.org/record/7405623)
